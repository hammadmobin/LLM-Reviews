# LLM-Reviews

This repository contains the code and experiments on detecting LLM-generated reviews in e-commerce platforms.

The project focuses on distinguishing human-written vs. AI-generated product reviews using a combination of textual features and metadata, such as verified purchase status, helpful votes, ratings, and review structure. It includes data preprocessing, synthetic review generation using large language models, feature engineering, and supervised classification experiments.

The goal is to evaluate the robustness of modern NLP models in identifying machine-generated content and to study how metadata can improve detection performance in real-world review systems.
